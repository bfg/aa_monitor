Net::INET6Glue - Make common modules IPv6 ready by hotpatching

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Net::INET6Glue; # include all glue
 use LWP;
 use Net::SMTP;
 use Net::FTP;
 ..

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Net::INET6Glue> is a collection of modules to make common modules IPv6 ready
by hotpatching them.

Unfortunatly the current state of IPv6 support in perl is that no IPv6 support
is in the core and that a lot of important modules (like L<Net::FTP>,
L<Net::SMTP>, L<LWP>,...) do not support IPv6 even if the modules for IPv6
sockets L<Socket6>, L<IO::Socket::INET6> are available.

This module tries to mitigate this by hotpatching.
Currently the following submodules are available:

=over 4

=item L<Net::INET6Glue::INET_is_INET6>

Makes L<IO::Socket::INET> behave like L<IO::Socket::INET6>, especially make it
capable to create IPv6 sockets. This makes L<LWP>, L<Net::SMTP> and others
IPv6 capable.

=item L<Net::INET6Glue::FTP>

Hotpatches L<Net::FTP> to support EPRT and EPSV commands which are needed to
deal with FTP over IPv6. Also loads L<Net::INET6Glue::INET_is_INET6>.
